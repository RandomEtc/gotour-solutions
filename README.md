I ran http://tour.golang.org/ on a plane and this is where I got to.

Most things pass the letter of the exercises but I need to read more Go before I'm confident that my solutions are idiomatic.

I'm not satisfied with 69 or 70, I think I need more structure to stop goroutines gracefully and/or close channels.

Comments/issues welcome :)
